            <p>A <code>non-fungible token (NFT)</code> is a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a digital ledger (blockchain).[1] NFTs can be used to represent easily-reproducible items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files as unique items (analogous to a certificate of authenticity), and use blockchain technology to establish a verified and public proof of ownership. Copies of the original file are not restricted to the owner of the NFT, and can be copied and shared like any file. The lack of interchangeability (fungibility) distinguishes NFTs from blockchain cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. </p>
            <p>The first NFT project was launched in 2015 on the Ethereum <code>blockchain</code>, and interest grew with the rise of interest in <code>crypto currencies</code>. Interest and the total monetary value of NFTs grew significantly in 2021, with sales of NFTs exceeding $2 billion during the first quarter of the year–more than 20 times that of the previous quarter.[2] NFTs have drawn criticism with respect to the energy cost and carbon footprint associated with validating blockchain transactions. </p>

            <p>In March, 2021, Injective Protocol (through the name BurntBanksy) destroyed a $95,000 original screen print entitled "Morons" from the famous English graffiti artist Banksy as an act of performance art which they minted and sold as a video NFT.[68] According to the performance artist, the act was a way to transfer a physical work of art to the NFT space.[69]</p>
            <p>The <code>CryptoPunks</code> are 10,000 uniquely generated characters. No two are exactly alike, and each one of them can be officially owned by a single person on the Ethereum blockchain. Originally, they could be claimed for free by anybody with an Ethereum wallet, but all 10,000 were quickly claimed. Now they must be purchased from someone via the marketplace that's also embedded in the blockchain. Via this market you can buy, bid on, and offer punks for sale. Below, you'll find information about the status of each Punk in the market. Punks with a blue background are not for sale and have no current bids. Punks with a red background are available for sale by their owner. Finally, punks with a purple background have an active bid on them. </p>

            <p>earliest system that resembles a modern-day NFT project is bitDNS, launched on the Namecoin blockchain on April 18, 2011. By burning a small fee of namecoins, users mint unique, transferable domain names for the pseudo-top-level domain .bit.[84] This system would later be used for user authentication[84] and artwork.[85] The first one-off NFT avant la lettre was minted on May 2, 2014, by Kevin McCoy, in preparation for the Seven on Seven conference at the New Museum in New York City.[85] The experiment of creating a "monetized graphic(s)"[86] live at the conference, on May 3, represented the second time a non-fungible, tradable blockchain marker was explicitly linked to a unique work of art, via on-chain metadata (enabled by Namecoin), and the first time it was sold,[86] in contrast to the multi-unit, fungible, metadata-less "colored coins" of other blockchains and Counterparty.</p>
            <p>In October 2015, the first fully-fledged NFT project, Etheria, was launched and demonstrated at DEVCON 1, Ethereum's first developer conference, in London, UK, three months after the launch of the Ethereum blockchain. Most of Etheria's 457 purchasable and tradable hexagonal tiles went unsold for more than 5 years until March 13, 2021, when renewed interest in NFTs sparked a buying frenzy. Within 24 hours, all tiles of the current version and a prior version, each hardcoded to 1 ETH ($0.43 cents at the time of launch), were sold for a total of $1.4 million.</p>
            <p>The ERC-721 standard was first proposed in 2017 via the Ethereum <code>Github</code>, following the launch of various NFT projects that year.[88][89] These include Curio Cards, CryptoPunks – a project to trade unique cartoon characters, released by the American studio Larva Labs on the Ethereum blockchain[90][91][92] – and Decentraland. All three projects were referenced in the original proposal along with Rare Pepe trading cards[88]. </p>

            <p> don’t think anyone can stop you, but that’s not really what I meant. A lot of the conversation is about NFTs as an evolution of fine art collecting, only with digital art.</p>
            <p>(Side note, when coming up with the line “buying my good tweets,” we were trying to think of something so silly that it wouldn’t be a real thing. So of course the founder of Twitter sold one for just under $3 million shortly after we posted the article.)</p>
