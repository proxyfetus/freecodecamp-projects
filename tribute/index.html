                        In Buddhism: He is regarded as the founder of the world religion of Buddhism, and revered by
                        Buddhists as an enlightened being,[8] who rediscovered an ancient path to freedom from
                        ignorance, craving and the cycle of rebirth and suffering. He taught for around 45 years and
                        built a large following, both monastic and lay.[9] His teaching is based on his insight into the
                        arising of suffering or dissatisfaction and its ending—the state called Nirvana (lit. vanishing
                        or extinguishing). A couple of centuries after his death he came to be known by the title
                        Buddha, which means "Awakened One" or "Enlightened One".[11] Gautama's teachings were compiled
                        by the Buddhist community in the Vinaya, his codes for monastic practice, and the Suttas, texts
                        based on his discourses. These were passed down in Middle-Indo Aryan dialects through an oral
                        tradition.[12][13] Later generations composed additional texts, such as systematic treatises
                        known as Abhidharma, biographies of the Buddha, collections of stories about the Buddha's past
                        lives known as Jataka tales, and additional discourses, i.e. the Mahayana sutras.

                        The Buddha was born into an aristocratic family in the Shakya clan, but eventually renounced lay
                        life. According to Buddhist tradition, after several years of mendicancy, meditation, and
                        asceticism, he awakened to understand the workings of the cycle of rebirth and how it can be
                        escaped. The Buddha then traveled throughout the Gangetic plain teaching and building a
                        religious community. The Buddha taught a middle way between sensual indulgence and the severe
                        asceticism found in the Indian śramaṇa movement.[10] He taught a training of the mind that
                        included ethical training, self-restraint, and meditative practices such as jhana and
                        mindfulness. The Buddha also critiqued the practices of Brahmin priests, such as animal
                        sacrifice and the caste system.

                        In the early texts, the Buddha also often refers to himself as Tathāgata (Sanskrit:
                        [tɐˈtʰaːɡɐtɐ]). The term is often thought to mean either "one who has thus gone" (tathā-gata) or
                        "one who has thus come" (tathā-āgata), possibly referring to the transcendental nature of the
                        Buddha's spiritual attainment.
